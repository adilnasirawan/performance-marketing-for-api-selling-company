Project Summary
Client Objective
To provide an executive-level performance reporting system in Looker Studio for 13 individual schools. The goal was to enable senior management to monitor traffi c, engagement, and lead generation metrics across all digital channels on a month-over-month (MoM) and year-over-year (YoY) basis.
Project Overview
This project involved designing a Looker Studio dashboard solution to present digital performance insights for 13 schools, each with its own GA4 and GSC property. We also integrated Meta Ads and Google Ads to provide a complete view of all key digital marketing channels.
The goal was to deliver executive-level visibility into traffi c and conversion metrics to support data-driven decision-making. The fi nal solution included 13 individual dashboards—one for each school—and a centralized executive summary for leadership oversight.
Dashboard Design & Structure
The report was structured into multiple interactive tabs, ensuring a user-friendly and drill-down-ready experience for executives and marketing leads. The major sections included:
1. Traffi c Overview (All Channels Combined)
A high-level dashboard showing combined metrics from all four platforms across all schools.
2. Individual Channel Dashboards
Each school had:
● A GA4 tab displaying sessions, engaged sessions, engagement rate, users, and leads.
● A GSC tab showcasing clicks, impressions, site CTR, average position, and clicks per average position.
● A Google Ads tab detailing campaign performance, including cost, conversions, impressions, and CTR.
● A Meta Ads tab outlining paid social performance with reach, leads, and cost-per-result metrics.
3. MoM and YoY Tabs
For every school, we included tabs comparing Month-over-Month (MoM) and Year-over-Year (YoY) performance. These helped leadership quickly identify trends, seasonality, and campaign effectiveness over time.
Interactive Features & Filters
To make the dashboards dynamic and actionable, we implemented:
Date Range Pickers – Users could select custom date ranges for all metrics.
Location Filters – Enabled region-specifi c breakdowns where applicable.
Traffi c Channel Filters – Data could be segmented by Organic, Referral, and Direct traffi c, allowing deeper analysis of acquisition channels and their impact on performance.
Impact & Outcome
The result was a scalable, clear, and visually compelling dashboard system that empowered non-technical executives to:
● Track digital performance for each school individually
● Identify underperforming traffi c channels or campaigns
● Compare current performance with historical benchmarks
● Make informed budget allocation and marketing strategy decisions
● This reporting system signifi cantly streamlined performance reviews and made campaign ROI more transparent for the leadership team.
